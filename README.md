# PRFormatter

## What is it

PR Formatter helps working in Scrum with GitHub and Trello.
It is a Chrome extension that links a Pull Request GitHub page to your current Trello board.
It will fetch the ID of the Trello card you are currently working on, and add the title and the description of the card to your PR.

## How it works

The extension will get the ID of the card you are currently working on, and will look for this card in the "Doing" column of the last Trello board you've seen.

## Installation
